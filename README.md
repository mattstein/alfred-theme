# Nerd Alfred Theme

My personal Alfred theme, which takes a smidge of inspiration from [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) and uses [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you’d like a free alternative to Berkeley Mono, you might consider [Server Mono](https://servermono.com) or [iA Writer Mono](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts)!

I might need to tinker with the contrast to satisfy my old eyes, but so far I’m pretty happy with it.

## Usage

Clone or download this repository, then double-click the `.alfredappearance` variant you want to import to Alfred’s **Appearance** section.

If you alternate between dark and light OS-level settings, select the light theme when you’re in light mode and the dark theme again when you’re in dark mode and Alfred will change between them automatically.
